# py-lotto-powerball
adapt an exisitng script

Take lotto.py and make a copy, changing what it does to pick a powerball tuple.

see http://powerball.com

What to do:

lotto.py does something. Read it, run it, then copy it to powerball.py and change its
behavior to implement this rule instead:

**"Players select five numbers from 1 to 69; and one POWERBALL number from 1 to 26."**

Run it a few times. If you actually run it, it generates numbers and you play those numbers, winning a big prize, pay your
ZipCode instructors 10% of the winnings. (That's only fair, right?)

No, I suppose I am kidding.
